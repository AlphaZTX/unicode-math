________________________
The UNICODE-MATH package
v0.3c

This package will provide a complete
implementation of unicode maths for XeTeX.

It is currently only supported by the fonts
"Cambria Math" and "Asana Math".

Basic usage:
  \setmathfont{Cambria Math}

THIS PACKAGE IS NOT YET READY FOR DISTRIBUTION!

____________
INSTALLATION

There are two DTX files in this repository:
    unicode-math.dtx
    maths-font-mappings.dtx

You can safely ignore maths-font-mappings; it contains code that
isn't being used for unicode-math, but might otherwise be useful
(hence it hasn't been deleted).
