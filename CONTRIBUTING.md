# Guidelines for issues and pull requests

## Issues

Thanks for taking the time to report an issue!
Any apologies that I take longer, sometimes *way longer*, than I should to address them.

There are two important key points for submitting an issue:
* When submitting an issue, please include a *complete* minimal example.
* When loading maths fonts, please do so by *filename* only.

For example, this is a good minimal example:

    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{unicode-math}
    \setmathfont{texgyrepagella-math.otf}
    \begin{document}
    \[
      x^2 + y^2 = z^2
    \]
    \end{document}

This is an example of a *bad* example:

    \usepackage{unicode-math}
    \setmathfont{TeX Gyre Pagella Math}

    % later:
    \[
      x^2 + y^2 = z^2
    \]

## Pull Requests

I'm usually not fussy! Generally I'll just be impressed you've taken the effort.
